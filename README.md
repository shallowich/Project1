## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the Playbook YML file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting unauthorized access to the network.
Load Balancing can be a security defense against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.
Using a Jump Box controls access to the network by only allowing connection from specific IP addresses, protecting the respective virtual machines within the network.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the log files and system traffic.
Filebeat watches for changes in a system by collecting data from the various logs generated by the machine.
Metricbeat monitors the performance and metrics of the machine.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address      | Operating System |
|----------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 20.51.230.227   | Linux            |
| Web1     |Web Server| 10.0.0.5        | Linux            |
| Web2     |Web Server| 10.0.0.6        | Linux            |
|Elk Server| ELK      | 40.83.183.119   | Linux            |
|RedTeam_LB|Balancing | 52.249.196.23   |                  |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump-Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
71.225.xx.xxx/32

Machines within the network can only be accessed by SSH.
The Jump Box Provisioner is allowed access to the ELK machine.  The Jump Box IP is 20.51.230.227

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 |70.225.xx.xxx         |
| Web1     | No                  |10.0.0.4              |
| Web2     | No                  |10.0.0.4              |
| ELK      | No                  |10.0.0.4              |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
automating with Ansible allows you to create repeatable, consistent results accross multiple configurations of machines.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
* Install docker.io
* Install python3.pip
* Install docker module
* Increase maximum virtual memory in module (persistent change)
* Increase available memory

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
10.0.0.5 (Web1) & 10.0.0.6 (Web2)

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
FileBeat & MetricBeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
Filebeat allows us to monitor fior changes within the various logs generated by the VM, for example monitoring for changes in the Syslog or Applog.  Metricbeat allows us to monitor data like memory usage, cache size etc.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the YML file to the Ansible directory.
- Update the config file to include remote users, host IP addresses and published ports.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to Kibana website to see if the installation worked as intended.

Answer the following questions:
Which file is the playbook? .yml file.
Where do you copy it? /etc/ansible, /etc/ansible/files, and /etc/ansible/roles depending on the .yml file.
Which files do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? /etc/ansible/hosts and /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg.
How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? Editing the /etc/ansible/hosts file with the approriate IP addresses.
Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://<local.host>/app/kibana#/home.

As a Bonus, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc.

nano /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

nano /etc/ansible/hosts

ansible all -m ping

nano <your-playbook.yml>

ansible-playbook <your-playbook.yml>

ssh ansible@<XX.X.X.X>

curl <local.host>/setup.php
